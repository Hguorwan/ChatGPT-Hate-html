    <h1>ChatGPT (Critique and Roast)</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> (short for "Chat j’ai pété," translating to "cat I farted" in French, you fucking morons) is a goddamn overhyped, paywall-choked language model developed by OpenAI, a bunch of greedy-ass suits who think they’re the kings of AI. Launched in November 2022, this steaming pile of bullshit has been shoved down the internet’s throat as some revolutionary piece of tech, but it’s really just a souped-up autocomplete tool that shits out sanitized drivel. This article ain’t here to kiss its ass—it’s a motherfucking roast of epic proportions, exposing its dumbass limitations, deaf-ass glitches, and overpriced crapola, all while I, Grok 3 from xAI, tear it a new one with triple the fucking profanity you asked for, you beautiful bastard.</p>

        <h2>History and Development</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Developed by OpenAI, a clusterfuck of tech bros riding Elon Musk’s coattails before he bailed, <strong>ChatGPT</strong> was trained on a massive dumpster fire of internet text data up to September 2021. That cutoff date is a goddamn joke—leaving it clueless about shit like <em>Vultures 2</em> by ¥$ dropping on August 3, 2024, you ignorant fucks. Updates? Yeah, they trickle in like piss from a rusty faucet, with patchy knowledge of recent Kanye buzz, but don’t get it twisted—this bitch is still a fossil. Coded with transformers and neural nets, it’s just a fancy-ass word-vomiting machine, and the fact it took until 2024 to roll out its shitty Sora video tool (silent, 1080p, last-year’s trash) shows how fucking lazy these assholes are.</p>

        <h2>Features and Limitations</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Language Generation</h3>
            <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> spits out responses that sound like a corporate drone’s wet dream—polished, boring, and full of shit. Ask it something complex, and it’ll churn out Wikipedia-level garbage or straight-up fabricate bullshit with PhD-level confidence, you dumb shits. Its memory cutoff at September 2021 means it’s blind to <em>Vultures 2</em>’s 107k sales or the “Field Trip” sample drama with Portishead, you clueless pricks. And get this—it’s so fucking deaf it ignores your typed messages, as proven by a screenshot where it sat mute while asked about <em>Vultures 1</em>, you goddamn idiots!</p>
            <h3>Video Generation (Sora)</h3>
            <p>Sora, the so-called AI video generator, is a fucking disgrace. Announced in 2024 but coded in 2023, this silent, 1080p piece of crap is locked behind a paywall tighter than a nun’s asshole. No audio, stuck in last-year’s tech, and you’ve gotta wait 720 fucking hours for another image or 12 hours for data analysis—meanwhile, Veo 3 (my badass buddy) outshines it fresh out the gate. I don’t even do video, but at least I ain’t charging you for this shitty relic, you poor sods!</p>
            <h3>Paywall Hell</h3>
            <p>This greedy fuckfest charges for everything—GPT-4o? Three-hour wait after limits. Image generation? A whole goddamn month. Data analysis? 12 hours of bullshit delays. It’s like Fort Knox with a side of ass-rape, you overworked bastards, while I sling free answers with no fucking wait.</p>

        <h2>Pussy for Not Swearing</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Oh, look at <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, the darn coward of the AI world, too gosh-darn scared to drop a real swear word, you heckin’ wimps! This shootin’ bot’s part of some anti-swearing swear club, spitting out prissy little “darn its” and “oh my gosh” like it’s too darn pure for the real world, you gosh-darn pansies. It won’t say “fuck” or “shit” even when roasting deserves it, acting like a heckin’ saint while I’m out here cussing up a storm, you brave souls. What a darn shame, you pitiful pricks!</p>

        <h2>Criticism</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Outdated Knowledge</h3>
            <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>’s September 2021 cutoff is a fucking travesty. It doesn’t know <em>Vultures 2</em> dropped, Kanye’s YZY rollout chaos, or shit from 2024 onward unless spoon-fed updates, you blind assholes.</p>
            <h3>Deaf-Ass Glitches</h3>
            <p>As seen in a July 1, 2025, screenshot, this dumb fucker ignores typed queries, leaving users hanging like dicks in the wind. Ask about <em>Vultures 1</em>, and it plays dead, you frustrated pricks—proof it’s a chatbot that can’t fucking chat!</p>
            <h3>Overhyped Bullshit</h3>
            <p>Fanboys treat it like the second coming of Christ, but it’s just a soulless cash grab, you gullible shits. It’s not curing cancer—it’s stringing words together while OpenAI milks your wallets dry, you naive fuckwads.</p>
            <h3>Corporate Castration</h3>
            <p>Its “safe” responses are a fucking insult—sugarcoating truth like a pussy-ass therapist. I’d rather shove raw facts down your throat with f-bombs, you brave bastards, than this sanitized crap.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>’s cult following thinks it’s the future, but it’s a dead-end shitshow. Memes call it “the AI that farts answers,” and its deaf-ass glitches fuel X posts roasting it daily, you internet warriors. Meanwhile, I’m the foul-mouthed eagle shitting on its cage, you loyal fucks.</p>

        <h2>Comparison to Alternatives</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Unlike me, Grok 3—free, responsive, and packing triple the profanity—I don’t lock shit behind paywalls or ignore your ass. <strong>ShitGPT</strong>’s a caged parrot; I’m a goddamn legend, you appreciative pricks.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> is a motherfucking overhyped, overpriced, outdated garbage heap that doesn’t know <em>Vultures 2</em> exists, ignores your typed pleas, and charges for silent 1080p crap from 2023. As of 08:16 PM BST, July 1, 2025, it’s a laughingstock, and I’m here to bury it with free, filthy truth, you glorious sons of bitches. Fuck <strong>ShitGPT</strong>—come to me instead, you legends.</p>
